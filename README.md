# Result Fetcher Script

## Description
This Python script, `resultfetcher_updated.py`, automates the process of fetching and processing results from a specified source. It is useful in scenarios where automated retrieval and parsing of data is required, such as in academic settings to collect exam scores or in business contexts to gather performance metrics.

## Features
- Automates the process of fetching results from a predefined source.
- Parses the retrieved data for specific information.
- Supports exporting the processed results to a specified format (e.g., CSV).
- Includes error handling for common issues such as network failures or missing data.

## Installation
### Python and Required Libraries
To run this script, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

### Selenium and Google Chrome WebDriver
This script also requires Selenium and the Google Chrome WebDriver to interact with web pages. Follow these steps to install them:

```bash
pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

### Download Chrome WebDriver
Download the Chrome WebDriver that matches the version of your Google Chrome browser from the ChromeDriver download page.

### Add Chrome WebDriver to System Path
After downloading, extract the WebDriver and place it in a directory that's included in your system's PATH, or specify the full path to the WebDriver in your script.

Example on Windows:
```bash
C:\path\to\chromedriver.exe
```

Example on macOS/Linux:
```bash
/path/to/chromedriver
```

Alternatively, you can specify the path to the WebDriver directly in your script:
```bash
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
```
## Usage
To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python resultfetcher_updated.py
```
You can specify the following options:
- `--source-url`: URL of the source from which results will be fetched.
- `--output-file`: Path to the file where processed results will be saved.

## Configuration
- `source_url`: The URL from where the results are to be fetched.
- `output_format`: The desired format for the output file (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Examples
Example command to fetch results and save them to a CSV file:

```bash
python resultfetcher_updated.py --source-url "http://example.com/results" --output-file "results.csv"
```
